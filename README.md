# TheLiarsDiceAIRound2Bot

Clojure Bot to participate in TheLiarsDiceAIContest

## Usage

1. install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) (maven for clojure)
2. cd to project root folder
3. run `lein uberjar` to compile a jar
4. jar is in `target` folder

I used [Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/) which I strongly recommend as a Clojure IDE
